part one:
- technical difficulties 
- embedded software < powerpoint

#### My Automation Information Technology
his responsibilities
- collaboration with bachelors and university projects
- sharing knowledge
- sees us as a partner not a sponsor
company is specialised in industrial automation
- software
- hardware design 
- mechanical (cabinet) design
- can connect us to pcb design people (?)
``(hq in deventer)``
they have own academy

### Specialisation in software design
"a→z"
start thinking before writing software
architecture design !!!!!

They specialise in PLC
> [!question]- ?
> A **programmable logic controller** (PLC) or programmable controller is an industrial computer that has been ruggedized and adapted for the control of manufacturing processes, such as assembly lines, machines, robotic devices, or any activity that requires high reliability, ease of programming, and process fault diagnosis.

→ SCADA for visualisation

**IT Software dept.**
- collect data from PLC,
- predict maintenance 

**Consultancy**
- senior and lead engineers

**Coaching and training**
incl. soft skill coaches

# Technical Knowledge
- embedded software (not much emphasis but mentioned)
- a lot of the higher level, dashboards cloud solutions, *planning*
- electrical planning and mechanical integration

# Things he said they can help with
- software architecture
- safety-first software planning

they can do something with all the information they get by looking at our software
first step, what are we going to do to translate a functional description in a document to a software architecture to code and then get the code working on hardware

they can develop our dashboard and cloud solutions
→ check if we can off-source solutions to them

→ advice on embedding software to mainpcb (i doubt)
→ advice on electrical design (≠pcb)

get EPLAN to help, talk about the software they use to plan electrical designs, 
→ useful for combining electrical design with mechanical

## DOCUMENTATION AND PLANNING
- documentation first
- Object-Oriented

→ [ISA88](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa88)

OEE
- dashboarding of product data

**Safety**
- CE certification
- cybersec, **ISA99**
- PL/SIL
- HIL
- machine safety 

? what is the role of the electrical engineers in your company 
→ (electrical design engineers) when you build a machine theres normally a big cabinet in it where all the hardware is situated. they design the cabinet and advise on all the hardware they are going to use, all the cables and harnesses, specifications, motors, pumps, embedded controllers, decision what hardware will be used
harness = integration of electrical design with mechanical design

(case study MTA)
1. standardisation of electrical design
2. implement it in EPLAN harness so they can implement it with the mechanical design


**People**
`marc waarle, hans vd dussen, jan tromp, eduard de grefte, johan hemrica, nikki reuvers, cindy bell, willy van dalen`


### Embedded software 
they don't do it lol 
just off-source to another company


# (next) Meeting info
**End of January - Start of February**
engineers meetup
- Software architecture
- Software documentation
- Network engineering (some doubts, we'll see)
- SIL safety planning
- HIL safety planning

honestly the main thing they can help us with is SIL/HIL testing that we otherwise wouldn't do, *maybe* the ground station interface.
Software planning help would have been amazing two weeks ago, but if we still need their help end of january we might as well drop the project and join emergence
